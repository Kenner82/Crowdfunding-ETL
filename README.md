# Crowdfunding ETL

## Project Overview

A .csv file with information on the backers for various crowdfunding campaigns was imported into Pandas and transformed into a DataFrame. The data was cleaned and reorganized, then exported as another .csv file. An ERD was established and used to create a SQL table to load the cleaned data into.
